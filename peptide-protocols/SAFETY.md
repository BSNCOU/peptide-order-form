## Reconstitution Process

### Before You Begin

**Preparation Checklist:**
- [ ] Peptide vial at room temperature (15-30 minutes)
- [ ] BAC water ready
- [ ] Alcohol swabs available
- [ ] Syringes prepared
- [ ] Clean workspace
- [ ] Sharps container nearby

### Step-by-Step Reconstitution

**Step 1: Prepare the Workspace**
- Clean surface with alcohol
- Lay out all supplies
- Wash hands thoroughly

**Step 2: Prepare the Vial**
- Remove peptide from refrigerator/freezer
- Allow to reach room temperature (15-30 min)
- Remove plastic cap
- Wipe rubber stopper with alcohol swab
- Allow to dry completely

**Step 3: Draw the BAC Water**
- Wipe BAC water vial stopper
- Draw appropriate amount (usually 2ml)
- Remove air bubbles by tapping syringe
- Keep needle sterile

**Step 4: Add Water to Peptide**
- Insert needle through stopper at an angle
- **Aim water down the side of the vial**
- Never spray directly onto powder
- Inject slowly and gently
- Remove needle when complete

**Step 5: Mix the Solution**
- **DO NOT SHAKE**
- Gently swirl or roll between hands
- Allow to sit if powder doesn't dissolve immediately
- Continue gentle swirling until fully dissolved
- Solution should be clear (slight cloudiness OK for some peptides)

**Step 6: Label the Vial**
- Write peptide name
- Note concentration (mg/ml)
- Date of reconstitution
- Expiration date (2-4 weeks from reconstitution)

### Common Reconstitution Volumes

**Standard Reconstitution:**
- 2ml BAC water (most common)
- Easy mathematics for dosing
- Good for standard insulin syringes

**Higher Concentration (Less Volume):**
- 1ml BAC water
- Stronger concentration
- Smaller injection volume
- May sting more

**Lower Concentration (More Volume):**
- 3-5ml BAC water
- Weaker concentration
- Larger injection volume
- More comfortable for some peptides (NAD+)

### Reconstitution Tips

**For Better Mixing:**
- Let sit for 5-10 minutes after adding water
- Gentle warmth from hands helps
- Never shake vigorously
- Some peptides take time to dissolve

**For Comfort:**
- More dilute = less sting
- Especially important for NAD+, some others
- Balance with injection volume preference

**For Accuracy:**
- Standard 2ml makes math easier
- Consider final dose you want to take
- Choose volume that allows accurate measurement

## Administration Techniques

### Injection Site Selection

**Subcutaneous Sites:**
- **Abdomen:** Most common, good absorption
  - 2 inches from belly button
  - Avoid centerline
  - Large area for rotation
  
- **Thigh:** Outer and front areas
  - Easy to reach
  - Good for self-administration
  
- **Upper Arm:** Back of arm
  - May need help
  - Good absorption

- **Buttocks:** Upper outer area
  - Comfortable for some
  - May need help or mirror

**Intramuscular Sites:**
- **Deltoid (shoulder):** Small volumes only
- **Vastus Lateralis (thigh):** Large muscle
- **Gluteus (buttock):** Large muscle
- **Ventrogluteal (hip):** Safe and effective

### Site Rotation

**Why Rotate:**
- Prevents lipohypertrophy (fatty lumps)
- Reduces scar tissue buildup
- Ensures consistent absorption
- Prevents site irritation

**Rotation Strategy:**
- Divide abdomen into quadrants
- Use different quadrant each day
- Wait at least 1 week before same exact spot
- Keep rotation log if helpful

### Subcutaneous Injection Technique

**Step-by-Step:**

1. **Prepare:**
   - Wash hands
   - Gather supplies
   - Choose injection site
   - Clean site with alcohol swab

2. **Draw Dose:**
   - Wipe vial top with alcohol
   - Draw slightly more than needed
   - Remove air bubbles (tap and push)
   - Adjust to exact dose
   - Re-cap safely if needed

3. **Inject:**
   - Pinch skin to create fold (2-3 inches)
   - Insert needle at 45-90° angle
   - Push needle in quickly but smoothly
   - Release skin pinch
   - Inject slowly and steadily
   - Count to 5 after injecting

4. **Withdraw:**
   - Pull needle straight out
   - Apply gentle pressure with alcohol swab
   - Don't rub injection site
   - Dispose of needle in sharps container

5. **After:**
   - Check for bleeding (normal if minor)
   - Apply bandage if needed
   - Log injection in records

### Intramuscular Injection Technique

**Step-by-Step:**

1. **Prepare:**
   - Same as subcutaneous
   - Choose IM site
   - Clean thoroughly

2. **Draw Dose:**
   - Same as subcutaneous
   - May use slightly larger needle (22-25g)

3. **Inject:**
   - Don't pinch skin
   - Insert at 90° angle
   - Insert quickly and smoothly
   - Aspirate (pull back) to check for blood
   - If blood, withdraw and try new site
   - If no blood, inject slowly
   - Count to 5

4. **Withdraw:**
   - Remove needle quickly
   - Apply pressure
   - Massage site gently (helps distribution)
   - Dispose properly

### Intranasal Administration

**For Peptides Like Semax, Selank:**

1. **Prepare:**
   - Clear nasal passages if needed
   - Have tissues ready
   - Measure dose into nasal spray or dropper

2. **Administer:**
   - Tilt head slightly back
   - Insert tip just inside nostril
   - Don't touch inside of nose
   - Spray or drop medication
   - Sniff gently inward
   - Keep head tilted for 30 seconds

3. **After:**
   - Don't blow nose for 10 minutes
   - Alternate nostrils if multiple doses
   - Clean applicator tip

### Special Techniques

**For Painful Injections (NAD+, etc.):**
- Ice area for 1-2 minutes before
- Use more diluted solution
- Inject very slowly (2-3 minutes)
- Massage area before and after
- Warm the vial gently in hands before drawing

**For Multiple Daily Injections:**
- Rotate sites systematically
- Use smallest needle gauge comfortable
- Consider insulin pen if available

## Dosage Calculations

### Understanding Concentrations

**Concentration Definition:**
- mg/ml (milligrams per milliliter)
- Example: 5mg peptide in 2ml water = 2.5mg/ml

**Common Concentrations:**
- 2ml reconstitution most common
- 5mg in 2ml = 2.5mg/ml
- 10mg in 2ml = 5mg/ml

### Insulin Syringe Basics

**Syringe Markings:**
- Usually marked in "units"
- 100 units = 1ml
- 50 units = 0.5ml
- 10 units = 0.1ml

**Common Syringe Sizes:**
- 0.3ml (30 units) - small doses
- 0.5ml (50 units) - medium doses
- 1ml (100 units) - larger doses

### Calculation Formula

**Basic Formula:**
```
Dose (mcg) ÷ Concentration (mg/ml) = Volume (ml)
Then convert ml to units: Volume (ml) × 100 = Units
```

### Calculation Examples

**Example 1: BPC-157**
- Have: 5mg in 2ml (2.5mg/ml = 2500mcg/ml)
- Want: 250mcg dose
- Calculation: 250mcg ÷ 2500mcg/ml = 0.1ml = 10 units

**Example 2: CJC-1295**
- Have: 5mg in 2ml (2.5mg/ml = 2500mcg/ml)
- Want: 100mcg dose
- Calculation: 100mcg ÷ 2500mcg/ml = 0.04ml = 4 units

**Example 3: Semaglutide**
- Have: 5mg in 2ml (2.5mg/ml = 2500mcg/ml)
- Want: 0.5mg (500mcg) dose
- Calculation: 500mcg ÷ 2500mcg/ml = 0.2ml = 20 units

**Example 4: NAD+**
- Have: 500mg in 5ml (100mg/ml)
- Want: 50mg dose
- Calculation: 50mg ÷ 100mg/ml = 0.5ml = 50 units

### Quick Reference Table

**For 5mg in 2ml (2.5mg/ml):**
| Dose Wanted | Units to Draw |
|-------------|---------------|
| 100mcg | 4 units |
| 150mcg | 6 units |
| 200mcg | 8 units |
| 250mcg | 10 units |
| 300mcg | 12 units |
| 500mcg | 20 units |
| 1mg | 40 units |

**For 10mg in 2ml (5mg/ml):**
| Dose Wanted | Units to Draw |
|-------------|---------------|
| 100mcg | 2 units |
| 250mcg | 5 units |
| 500mcg | 10 units |
| 1mg | 20 units |
| 2mg | 40 units |

### Calculator Method

**Step-by-Step:**
1. Convert dose to mcg (if in mg)
   - 1mg = 1000mcg
   
2. Convert vial contents to mcg
   - 5mg = 5000mcg
   
3. Divide to get concentration
   - 5000mcg ÷ 2ml = 2500mcg/ml
   
4. Calculate volume needed
   - Dose (mcg) ÷ concentration (mcg/ml) = ml
   
5. Convert ml to units
   - ml × 100 = units

### Avoiding Errors

**Double-Check:**
- Verify peptide amount in vial
- Verify reconstitution volume
- Calculate concentration
- Calculate dose volume
- Draw dose carefully
- Verify in syringe before injecting

**Common Mistakes:**
- Confusing mg and mcg (1000× difference!)
- Using wrong reconstitution volume in calculation
- Reading syringe markings incorrectly
- Not accounting for different concentrations

## Troubleshooting

### Reconstitution Issues

**Problem: Peptide Won't Dissolve**
- Let sit longer (10-30 minutes)
- Gentle swirling (never shake)
- Slight warmth from hands
- Some peptides take time
- If still not dissolved after 1 hour, may be degraded

**Problem: Solution is Cloudy**
- Some peptides naturally slightly cloudy
- May clear with time and gentle swirling
- If remains very cloudy or has particles, don't use
- Check expiration dates

**Problem: Rubber Stopper Issues**
- Use sharp, new needle
- Insert at angle, not straight down
- Don't repeatedly puncture same spot
- Consider vial adapter

### Administration Issues

**Problem: Injection Stings/Burns**
- Use more dilute solution
- Inject more slowly
- Ice area before injection
- Room temperature peptide
- Different injection site

**Problem: Bleeding at Site**
- Normal if minor
- Apply pressure for 2-3 minutes
- Don't rub
- Use smaller gauge needle
- Avoid blood vessels (visible veins)

**Problem: Bruising**
- Usually not serious
- Avoid aspirin/NSAIDs if possible
- Use smaller needle
- Don't inject into bruised area
- Apply ice after injection

**Problem: Lumps at Injection Site**
- Rotate sites more frequently
- Massage area gently after injection
- Use different site until resolved
- Ensure room temperature peptide
- Consider alternating SC and IM

### Storage Issues

**Problem: Forgot to Refrigerate**
- If <8 hours, likely OK
- If >8 hours, potency may be reduced
- Don't refreeze reconstituted peptide
- When in doubt, discard

**Problem: Accidentally Froze Reconstituted**
- Most peptides damaged by freezing
- Discard and reconstitute new vial
