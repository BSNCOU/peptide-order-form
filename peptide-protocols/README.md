## Overview

This repository contains detailed protocols for the safe and effective use of various peptides. Each protocol includes:

- Peptide specifications and characteristics
- Reconstitution instructions
- Dosage guidelines
- Administration methods
- Storage requirements
- Safety precautions
- Expected outcomes

## Safety and Handling

### General Safety Guidelines

1. **Sterile Technique**: Always use sterile equipment and maintain aseptic conditions
2. **Storage**: Store lyophilized peptides at -20°C or colder
3. **Reconstitution**: Use bacteriostatic water (BAC water) unless otherwise specified
4. **Handling**: Avoid direct sunlight and extreme temperatures
5. **Disposal**: Properly dispose of needles and vials according to local regulations

### Important Warnings

⚠️ **These protocols are for informational purposes only. Always consult with a qualified healthcare provider before using any peptide.**

## General Guidelines

### Reconstitution Process

1. Remove peptide vial from refrigeration and allow to reach room temperature
2. Clean the rubber stopper with an alcohol swab
3. Draw the appropriate amount of bacteriostatic water into a sterile syringe
4. Inject the water slowly down the side of the vial (not directly onto the powder)
5. Gently swirl (do not shake) until powder is fully dissolved
6. Label the vial with reconstitution date
7. Store reconstituted peptide in refrigerator (2-8°C)

### Administration Guidelines

- Use insulin syringes (typically 0.5ml or 1ml)
- Subcutaneous injection is most common route
- Rotate injection sites to prevent tissue damage
- Follow proper injection technique
- Maintain injection log for tracking

## Protocol Documentation

Detailed protocols for specific peptides are available in the `/protocols` directory:

- [Weight Management Protocols](protocols/weight-management.md)
- [Growth Hormone Protocols](protocols/growth-hormone.md)
- [Tissue Repair Protocols](protocols/tissue-repair.md)
- [Anti-Aging Protocols](protocols/anti-aging.md)
- [Cognitive Enhancement Protocols](protocols/cognitive.md)

## Storage Guidelines

### Lyophilized (Powder) Storage
- Temperature: -20°C to -80°C
- Shelf life: 1-2 years when properly stored
- Keep away from light and moisture

### Reconstituted Storage
- Temperature: 2-8°C (refrigerator)
- Shelf life: 2-4 weeks (varies by peptide)
- Protect from light
- Do not freeze

## Dosage Calculation

### Example Calculation

If you have a 5mg vial and reconstitute with 2ml of BAC water:
- 5mg = 5000mcg
- 5000mcg / 2ml = 2500mcg/ml
- 2500mcg/ml / 100 units = 25mcg per unit on insulin syringe
