## Retatrutide

### Overview
Retatrutide is a triple agonist (GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon receptor) showing promising results for weight loss and metabolic improvement.

### Available Specifications
- **RT5**: 5mg/10vials
- **RT10**: 10mg/10vials

### Reconstitution
- Reconstitute with 2ml BAC water

### Dosage Protocol

**Weeks 1-4**: 2mg once weekly
**Weeks 5-8**: 4mg once weekly
**Weeks 9-12**: 8mg once weekly
**Week 13+**: 12mg once weekly (maximum)

### Administration
- Subcutaneous injection
- Once weekly
- Consistent day and time recommended

### Expected Outcomes
- Significant weight loss (potentially higher than other GLP-1 agonists)
- Improved metabolic parameters
- Enhanced energy expenditure

### Monitoring
- Regular weight checks
- Blood glucose monitoring if diabetic
- Lipid panel every 3 months
- Liver function tests

## Cagrilintide

### Overview
Cagrilintide is an amylin analog that reduces appetite and food intake, often combined with GLP-1 agonists for enhanced effects.

### Available Specifications
- **CGL5**: 5mg/10vials
- **CGL10**: 10mg/10vials
- **CS5**: Cagrilintide + Semaglutide 2.5mg+2.5mg
- **CS10**: Cagrilintide + Semaglutide 5mg+5mg

### Reconstitution
- Reconstitute with 2ml BAC water

### Dosage Protocol

**Solo Use:**
- Start: 0.6mg once weekly
- Increase: 1.2mg once weekly after 4 weeks
- Maximum: 2.4mg once weekly

**Combined with Semaglutide:**
- Follow combination product guidelines
- Enhanced weight loss effects

### Administration
- Subcutaneous injection
- Can be injected at same time as other peptides (different sites)

### Expected Outcomes
- Reduced food intake
- Enhanced satiety
- Weight loss: 5-10% (solo), 15-20% (combined)

## General Guidelines for All Weight Management Peptides

### Diet Recommendations
- High protein intake (1.6-2.2g per kg body weight)
- Adequate fiber (25-35g daily)
- Balanced macronutrients
- Whole, unprocessed foods
- Adequate hydration (3-4L daily)

### Exercise Recommendations
- Resistance training 3-4x per week
- Cardiovascular exercise 150+ minutes weekly
- Daily movement and steps (10,000+ steps)
- Flexibility and mobility work

### Monitoring
- Weekly weight measurements
- Monthly body composition analysis
- Regular blood work (every 3-6 months)
- Track measurements (waist, hips, etc.)
- Monitor energy levels and well-being

### Safety Considerations
- Start with lowest effective dose
- Titrate slowly to minimize side effects
- Stay hydrated, especially with GLP-1 agonists
- Report severe side effects immediately
- Regular medical supervision recommended

### When to Stop or Adjust
- Severe persistent nausea/vomiting
- Signs of pancreatitis (severe abdominal pain)
- Allergic reactions
- Achievement of weight goals (can reduce to maintenance)
- Pregnancy or planned pregnancy
