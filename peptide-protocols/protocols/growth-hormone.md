### Dosage Protocols

**During Testosterone Therapy:**
- 250-500IU 2-3x weekly
- Maintains testicular function
- Prevents testicular atrophy

**Post Cycle Therapy (PCT):**
- 2000IU every other day for 10-14 days
- Then transition to SERMs if needed

**Fertility Protocol:**
- 1000-2000IU 3x weekly
- Minimum 3 months
- Monitor with semen analysis

### Administration
- Subcutaneous or intramuscular
- Rotate injection sites
- Can be same syringe as testosterone (if IM)

### Expected Outcomes
- Maintained testicular size
- Preserved fertility
- Normal intratesticular testosterone
- Prevention of testicular atrophy
- Improved sense of well-being (on TRT)

### Monitoring
