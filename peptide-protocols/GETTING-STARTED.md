## What Are Peptides?

### Simple Explanation
Peptides are short chains of amino acids (the building blocks of proteins) that act as signaling molecules in your body. They tell your cells to perform specific functions.

### How They Work
- **Natural:** Your body already makes many of these peptides
- **Specific:** Each peptide has targeted effects
- **Signaling:** They communicate instructions to cells
- **Temporary:** Effects stop when you stop using them

### Common Uses
- **Healing:** Faster recovery from injuries
- **Performance:** Better athletic results
- **Weight Loss:** Appetite control and metabolism
- **Anti-Aging:** Cellular health and longevity
- **Cognitive:** Mental clarity and focus
- **Wellness:** Overall health optimization

- **Protocol:** 250mcg once daily, 4-6 weeks
- **Administration:** Subcutaneous, any time
- **Cost:** Moderate
- **Learn More:** [Tissue Repair Protocols](protocols/tissue-repair.md#bpc-157)

**2. Ipamorelin (IP5 or IP10)**
- **Why:** Safe, effective, noticeable results
- **Good for:** Muscle building, fat loss, recovery, anti-aging
- **Protocol:** 200mcg before bed, optionally add morning/post-workout

- **Cost:** Moderate
- **Learn More:** [Growth Hormone Protocols](protocols/growth-hormone.md#ipamorelin)

**3. Selank (SK5)**
- **Why:** Gentle, anxiolytic, cognitive benefits
- **Good for:** Anxiety reduction, focus, stress management
- **Protocol:** 250mcg 1-2x daily, 4-6 weeks
- **Administration:** Intranasal or subcutaneous
- **Cost:** Moderate

**Not Recommended as First Peptide:**
- Semaglutide/Tirzepatide (requires titration, potential side effects)
- FOXO4-DRI (advanced, senolytic)
- Complex blends (better once experienced)
- Very high-dose protocols

### Making Your Choice

**Consider:**
1. **Your primary goal:** What do you want to achieve?
2. **Tolerance for complexity:** How many injections daily?
3. **Administration preference:** SC injection vs. intranasal?
4. **Budget:** What can you afford sustainably?
5. **Time commitment:** Can you maintain the schedule?

**Example Decision Process:**
- "I want to heal my tennis elbow" → BPC-157
- "I want better recovery and muscle building" → Ipamorelin
- "I want to reduce anxiety and improve focus" → Selank
- "I want help with weight loss" → Wait, start with simpler peptide first

## Step-by-Step First Use

### Part 1: Reconstitution (Mixing)

**Day 1 - First Time Mixing:**

1. **Prepare Workspace** (10 minutes)
   - Clean surface with alcohol
   - Lay out all supplies
   - Wash hands thoroughly
   - Read instructions one more time

2. **Allow Peptide to Warm** (15-30 minutes)
   - Remove peptide from freezer/fridge
   - Leave at room temperature
   - Don't open yet

3. **Set Up for Mixing**
   - Remove plastic cap from peptide vial
   - Wipe rubber stopper with alcohol swab
   - Let dry completely (30 seconds)
   - Open BAC water
   - Wipe BAC water stopper with alcohol

4. **Draw the Water** (2-3 minutes)
   - Remove syringe from package (don't touch needle)
   - Insert into BAC water vial
   - Draw 2ml (to the "200" or "2ml" mark)
   - Remove air bubbles by tapping and pushing
   - Verify you have exactly 2ml

5. **Add Water to Peptide** (2-3 minutes)
   - Insert needle into peptide vial at an angle
   - **Aim water down the SIDE of the vial** (not directly at powder)
   - Inject slowly and gently
   - Remove needle
   - DO NOT SHAKE
   - Gently swirl or roll between hands

6. **Wait for Dissolution** (5-10 minutes)
   - Let vial sit if powder doesn't dissolve immediately
   - Gently swirl occasionally
   - Solution should become clear
   - Some peptides take longer - be patient

7. **Label Your Vial**
   - Peptide name: _______________
   - Concentration: _____ mg/ml
   - Mixed on: ___/___/___
   - Expires: ___/___/___ (2-4 weeks from mix date)

8. **Store Properly**
   - Place in refrigerator (not freezer)
   - Keep upright
   - Away from light
   - In a safe place

**Congratulations!** You've successfully reconstituted your first peptide. Take a break before your first injection.

### Part 2: First Injection

**Later the Same Day or Next Day:**

**Before Starting:**
- [ ] Review injection technique
- [ ] Have all supplies ready
- [ ] Choose injection site
- [ ] Calculate your dose (see below)
- [ ] Set aside 15-20 minutes with no interruptions

**Calculate Your First Dose:**

Example for BPC-157 (5mg in 2ml):
- You want: 250mcg (0.25mg)
- You have: 5mg in 2ml = 2.5mg/ml = 2500mcg/ml
- Calculation: 250mcg ÷ 2500mcg/ml = 0.1ml = 10 units

*Use the [dosage calculator section](SAFETY.md#dosage-calculations) for your specific peptide*

**Step-by-Step Injection:**

1. **Gather Supplies**
   - Peptide vial (from refrigerator)
   - New insulin syringe
   - 2 alcohol swabs
   - Sharps container nearby
   - Notebook to log dose

2. **Prepare**
   - Wash hands thoroughly
   - Clean work surface
   - Let peptide warm slightly in hands (2-3 min)

3. **Draw Your Dose**
   - Wipe peptide vial top with alcohol swab
   - Remove syringe from wrapper
   - Insert needle into vial
   - Turn upside down
   - Pull plunger to draw slightly more than needed
   - Tap out air bubbles
   - Adjust to exact dose
   - Verify amount one more time

4. **Prepare Injection Site**
   - Choose site (abdomen is easiest for first time)
   - Clean area with alcohol swab
   - Let dry completely (30 seconds)
   - Take a deep breath

5. **Inject** (You've got this!)
   - Pinch skin to make a fold (2-3 inches)
   - Insert needle at 45-90 degree angle with quick, smooth motion
   - Don't need to go deep - just through skin
   - Release pinch
   - Slowly press plunger to inject
   - Count to 5 slowly
   - Pull needle straight out
   - Apply gentle pressure with clean alcohol swab

6. **After Injection**
   - Immediately place needle in sharps container
   - Check injection site (minor redness normal)
   - Apply bandage if needed (usually not necessary)
   - Return peptide to refrigerator
   - Wash hands

7. **Log Your Dose**
   ```
   Date: ___________
   Time: ___________
   Peptide: BPC-157
   Dose: 250mcg (10 units)
   Site: Right abdomen
   Notes: First injection! Went smoothly, minor sting.
   ```

8. **Monitor**
   - Set timer for next dose
   - Note any immediate reactions (usually none)
   - Continue normal activities

**That's it!** You've done your first peptide injection. Each one will get easier.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Will peptides show up on drug tests?**
A: Most standard drug tests don't screen for peptides. However, some athletic organizations test for specific peptides. Check your organization's rules.

**Q: How long until I see results?**
A: Varies by peptide and goal:
- Healing: 2-6 weeks
- Weight loss: 4-12 weeks
- Muscle building: 6-12 weeks
- Cognitive: Days to weeks
- Anti-aging: Weeks to months

**Q: Can I fly with peptides?**
A: Reconstituted peptides need refrigeration, making air travel challenging. Lyophilized (powder) peptides are more travel-friendly. Check TSA and destination country rules.

**Q: Do peptides need to be cycled?**
A: Many do. Each peptide has specific recommendations. See individual protocols.

**Q: Are peptides legal?**
A: In most places, peptides are legal for research purposes. Regulations vary by country and peptide. Not FDA-approved for human use in most cases.

**Q: Can I take peptides with medications?**
A: Usually yes, but always check with healthcare provider. Some interactions possible.

**Q: What if I miss a dose?**
A: Take it when you remember if it's within a few hours. Otherwise, skip and resume normal schedule. Don't double up.

**Q: Do peptides need PCT (post-cycle therapy)?**
A: Most don't. HCG and some hormone-related peptides might need consideration. Check specific protocols.
